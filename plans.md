1. This can be a brigade analyzer, then later we can do:
   - State of a countries military including research
   - State of a countries reinforcement potential / danger for reinforcing in a multiplayer game
   - State of a countries economy
   - Number of $ countries have compared to their GDP; and notifications if people do the money grant glitch
   - Size to military power ratio.
   - Projected deaths / winners of a war (hard)
   - Navy, brigade, miltech, analysis if a nation is playing optimally.
   - If a nation has unbuilt railroads / states without factories.
   - How many brigades below cap a country is in a ranking.
   - Top countries suceptible to invasion (Based on military power which a function of brigades, military tech, and difference from the max military tech of all nations)
